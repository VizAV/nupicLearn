The example in http://nupic.docs.numenta.org/1.0.4.dev0/quick-start/opf.html is not working because we dont have the data files

Steps:
1. We need to create a model using the params (it will be called MODEL factory)
    1.1 model_params understanding: check model.yaml
    a. Encoders:
        Consumption: RandomDistributedScalarEncoder

2. enableInference will tell us which field to predict

3. For each line in the data file, generate the input file in the correct format and use model.run(input)

4. Predict how many steps you want in the future


OPF data structure: Has the following models

    BaseModel

    HTM prediction model

    two-gram model

    Previous value model
